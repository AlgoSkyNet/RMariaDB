Update that includes another attempt to fix build errors on Solaris.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.3
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* Package links statically with libmariadb or libmysql, hence the size.

## Reverse dependencies

Checked dbplyr without new errors or warnings.
